RESPONSES:

Question 1: How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

  The use of user stories is very importannt in gathering and implementing user needs into the program. As the final user,
  these individuals are one of the most important stakeholders of the whole program. Listening to the end-users you can find
  what functions they want to see, and how it will benefit them. This in the end will hopefully drive up the demand of the
  program.
  
Question 2: How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

  I feel that most of the agile processes we learned in terms of scrum teams this term would be more than beneficial to use in
  future development especially in a team setting. These processes help to promote better communication and efficiency across 
  all parts of the team. I would approach most if not all development projects with a agile methodology, it gives room for change
  and often has better outcomes than the waterfall approach.
  
Question 3: What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

  The simple answer to this I feel is to just be open-minded and respectful. Be open to the ideas and opinions of other group
  members and be respectful when communicating with one another. This can promote good team morale and make the group more productive
